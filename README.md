This TensorFlow code implements K-fold cross-validation for training a deep learning model (ResNet50) on an image classification task. It begins by defining a custom F1-score metric using TensorFlow and sets the data directories, constants, and hyperparameters. Data augmentation and normalization are applied using the `ImageDataGenerator`. The code initializes K-fold cross-validation, builds a ResNet50-based model, compiles it, and then trains the model for each fold. The training history is stored for later analysis. After K-fold training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set. Finally, the code plots the average training and validation metrics (loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) across folds for each epoch. The metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and the custom F1-score metric defined earlier. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the model's performance and generalization across different folds.
